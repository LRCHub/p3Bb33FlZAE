You don't understand the pattern of my life
Because my life has got no pattern
You don't see and you can't feel the wind
That's blowing at my back and saying move boy

You think this burning fever in my heart is just a folly
And I'm throwin' away my happiness by leaving you
Well, it's my life, throw it away if I want to

I've tried my best to plant my feet
And stay with you but all I feel is roots grow
And what man wants a woman
Who won't satisfy his heart and soothe his ego

I sleep all day and run all night
And you tell me that that ain't right
That ain't what the husbands of your friends do
But it's my life, throw it away if I want to

You try to make me think my nonconforming life
Has colored me some evil shade
You delight in filling up my mind with
Little bits of guilt you think I oughta feel

Well I'm tired of feeling guilty
And I'm tired of having nothing
And I'm throwin' away this life
You've had me shackled to
It's my life, throw it away if I want to

I've tried my best to plant my feet
And stay with you but all I feel is roots grow
And what man wants a woman
Who won't satisfy his heart and soothe his ego

I sleep all day and run all night
And you tell me that that ain't right
That ain't what the husbands of your friends do
But it's my life, throw it away if I want to
